[Time Log](TimeLog.md)

### Week 1

1/18/2016 

Tasks Completed:
 * Chose a project goal
 * Reviewed SkinnySki.com 
 * Created this repository 
 * Wrote the problem statement
 * Started documenting the project plan
 * Began listing technologies and how they fit in this project
 
I have a solid idea for the individual project and am anxious to get started. One area I struggled with a little bit was getting specific on the project plan with regard to what exactly I'll be doing in the later weeks. I think once I have the screen layout complete this coming week, it will make it much easier to add more detail to the plan. 

I also started looking at a few different services that could be used:

* Here's the home page for the google maps web services: https://developers.google.com/maps/web-services/overview?hl=en This can be used to display a map of the trail location.
* A service to identify the current snow depth, most recent snowfal, etc.  Looks like this data is available: http://www.weather.gov/nerfc/snow, but I did not quickly find a service that returns the data. Will keep searching. Scraping the details from something like this, may work as well: http://www.nohrsc.noaa.gov/nsa/reports.html?region=National&var=snowdepth&dy=2016&dm=1&dd=24&units=e&sort=value&filter=0
* A service for current weather conditions migth be helpful as well. http://openweathermap.org looks promising and they have a free tier. There's also some integration with google maps, so I think I may be able to project weather data over the google map?

### Week 2

1/29/2016

Where did the week go?!?!  Prep for classes and my grad class took up a fair amount of time this week, but I set aside a little time today to work on the screen design. I had said I was not going to go fancy with the design and would just whiteboard it or draw on paper, but when I sat down to do it, I really did want to do something a little prettier, AND using a tool allows copy and paste, which is faster than redrawing (for me anyway). So... I did a quick search of free wireframe tools available. One of the first I found with a "free wireframe tool" Google search was https://wireframe.cc/pro/.  I signed up for the 7-day free trial, learned the ins and outs of the tool, and created my wireframes in about 1 1/2 hours.  You can view the wireframes, complete with links here: https://wireframe.cc/pro/pp/af3ee6b9238237 and I also exported them as images into this repository since after the 7-day trial I'm not sure if I'll still be able to use that link or not.   I felt like this was a valuable process - it forced me to think about what I really want/need to capture and how to structure the site itself. I'm sure there will be tweaks as I build it out, but I think I'm in good shape to create the real jsps and the database.  

I also created a web application project in intelliJ and connected it to my project repository in github. This way my code, journa, plan and all related documents are in a single place.  I recorded a short video as I did this so others can see one approach to adding a remote.  The git hub article on adding a remote is [here](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-remote/).  There are some plugins for editing/previewing markdown in intelliJ. I installed all of the recommended plugins. The HTML preview is a nice option.

Did a first deploy of my project website to openshift:  built a war in intellij of that new project and deployed to openshift using the tomcat manager.  It's not much to look at, but it's good to confirm the process. Here it is: http://tomcat-madjava.rhcloud.com/FatBikeTrailReports%5Fwar/

Created all jsps with content placeholders.  

1/30/2016 

Reviewed the wireframes with a potential users. Made a few small updates to include grooming type and reworded a few items for clarity.

### Week 3

2/2/2016

Added unit testing, logging, and hibernate to the application to set up for 
demonstrating DAOs and Hibernate. Created packages, added a User entity and 
built the persistence layer to demonstrate both a sql and hibernate dao. Only
 one method is built out at this point, along with a test for it. This was a 
 good way to ensure everything is connected and working before I build out 
 more. Eventually I'll remove the SQL dao, it's in there as an example for 
 student for now. 
 
 Ran into an issue with hibernate - needed the geronimo jar. We did not run 
 into this last semester so either this is related to tomEE or the new 
 version of intelliJ. 

2/5/2016

Designed and created all the tables today. IntelliJ's database view is even 
better than I thought. Originally I named a table "user" and decided I wanted
 to call it "users" instead.  I already had a dao written (as a demo for 
 class) with sql referring to "user". Changing the name of the table in the 
 database few, prompted the change automatically in the dao. How cool is 
 that?! It did not, however change user to users in the hibernate.cfg.xml, 
 but I have to wonder if there isn't a plugin that might handle making the 
 changes in the hibernate configs too. If not, it could be a useful addition.
  Ooh, writing plugins for IDEs - possible independent research topic. 

### Week 4

2/12/2016

Added in the authentication/authorization piece today. I had 
originally designed a join table between the users and users_roles table, 
called user_role and was storing the roles in a role table. I had hoped I 
could (relatively easily) configure tomcat for this, however,  tomcat's 
JDBCRealm relies specifically on a user table and a user roles table that each have a 
 username column making my join table unnecessary. Similarly, the user
  roles tables must have the role name on it. To keep things as simple as 
  possible for class examples, I am back to the structure tomcat requires 
  which meant eliminating the role and user_role tables. 
   
Regenerated the database diagrams to account for above.
  
The current config is set such that anyone can view pages listed immediately 
  under the web directory. The pages in the "user" directory require login 
  and the user role.
  
2/13/2016
  
  Added in bootstrap. I haven't worked with bootstrap before, but it was 
  pretty easy to add.  I chose to copy in files rather than pointing to the 
  CDN locations so that the application will work if I'm offline.  Not 100% 
  sure if I have the best structure for housing the js/css/fonts, etc, but 
  it's a start. Also made the navbar more dynamic - took me a little while as
   I'm rusty with jquery/javascript - it's been a LOOOOONG time since I 
   worked with those. 
   
   Resources: 
   * [Setting Navbar items to active](https://rjartiaga.wordpress.com/2015/03/25/bootstrap-navbar-classactive/)
   * [Bootstrap tutorial](http://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/)
   
Automatically generated entities for each table along with the hibernate 
config. I'm not confident the various relationships are built correctly with 
the automatic portion and this may have had to do with not generating all 
entities at the same time.  This is basically a note to myself to check on 
this going forward.  Regardless of whether some of the generated items will 
need tweaking, it was really nice to be able to quickly get the classes and 
hibernate config built.  
  
### Week 7
3/2/2016
 
Time got away from me the last couple weeks with some major projects due in 
my grad class and project reviews/grading for Advanced Java. This week that 
grade class ended, and I have just under a week before the next 
one starts, so I need to hit the Fat Bike Trail Reports application hard to 
catch back up!

I looked at the OpenWeatherMap api today to get current weather data by zip 
code. http://openweathermap.org/api. This does not seem to have snow depth, 
and I'd really like to be able to stick with one weather service.  Here is a 
possibility but looks like it is paid only: http://www.meteogroup
.com/en/gb/sectors/media/mobile-apps/weather-api.html. From what I'm finding,
 services tend to provide snow depth data  for ski resorts. I may need to add this as a 
 trail report  item so we have a way to collect the data ourselves.  Found 
 it! The data is here:  http://www.nohrsc.noaa.gov/nsa/reports.html?region=Northern_Great_Lakes&var=snowdepth&dy=2016&dm=3&dd=2&units=e&sort=value&filter=0
 So I could grab the text file for this if there isn't a service behind it.  

3/3/2016 There's a team in the evening section who may take on the task of 
 creating a
  service to access the snow depth based on a zip code using the data link 
  above. :)
  Added the user signup/registration functionality. This is not done, but is 
  a first cut at adding the user from a form to the db. Need to add bootstrap
   styling and validation to the form.
  
3/5/2016 Decided to use Bootstrap Validator as my independent research topic.
 It's been a long time since I've done any frontend development and Bootstrap
  is new to me.  I know there is a lot of slick validation that can be added 
  in as well, so after poking around at a few options, I decided to go with 
  Bootstrap Validator for now: http://1000hz.github
  .io/bootstrap-validator/#validator-examples. Honestly, I chose it because 
  it was one of the top results in a google search and I was able to get it 
  working pretty quickly. 
 
3/6/2016 Added in the TrailDao and TrailReportDao. When I was writing unit 
tests, I noticed tests failing because the id of the inserted record was 
being returned as 0.  Turns out the generated hbm.xml file did not have the
 the generator class set to native:   
       ```<id name="id" type="int" column="id">
            <generator class="native"/>
          </id>```
I'm noticing as I build the daos, that they are all similar, I think these 
could all be a subclass of some abstract Dao.  See this as an example: http://www.java2s.com/Code/Java/Hibernate/GenericDaoFindAll.htm 

### Week 9

3/24 I bought the domain fatbiketrailreports.com today for $.99 on goDaddy. 
I set this up so that the domain points to the application on 
openshift. This was very easy to configure right on the goDaddy site.

Added jstl impl library to the project so I can use the jstl tags. Now 
displaying all trail reports on the index page in a table. Not pretty, but it
 is displaying data. 
 
3/25 I set up the database on openshift today. I'm finally forced to do 
this work because index.jsp relies on the db, so to get things working at all
 on openshift, I need to get the database up there.

1. First step was to get a dump of the sql: 

```
Paulas-MacBook-Pro:bin paulawaite$ sudo ./mysqldump -u root -p  --databases 
FAT_BIKE_TRAIL_REPORTS > /Users/paulawaite/Documents/dump.sql
                                         Enter password: 
                                         Paulas-MacBook-Pro:bin paulawaite$ 
```

1. Run the sql on openshift. Voila! That's it!
                                 
*EXCEPT* the version of MySql on Openshift is different from what I have 
 locally. So I wasn't able to use the CURRENT_TIMESTAMP for my 
DATETIME fields. "It is 
version specific and is now allowed for DATETIME columns as of version 5.6 
http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/timestamp-initialization.html"
        
I also had repeated issues with an invalid token messages. I was working at 
the public library at the time and wonder if it wasn't related to their wifi.
 If I opened a new browser tab and went back into phpmyadmin, I could run sql
  once and then would get the token error again.  
    
Next up I needed to configure the server.xml on my openshift tomcat instance to 
use the new database for authentication. Remember the jdbc realm authentication 
work we did earlier in the semester? Create a tomcat user with read only 
access in the database and then add something like this to the openshift server
.xml. Your server/host will be different.                    

```
<Realm className="org.apache.catalina.realm.JDBCRealm"
      driverName="com.mysql.jdbc.Driver"
      connectionURL="jdbc:mysql://127.5.237.130:3306/FAT_BIKE_TRAIL_REPORTS?user=tomcat&amp;password=tomcat"
      userTable="users" userNameCol="email_address" userCredCol="password"
      userRoleTable="users_roles" roleNameCol="role"/>
```                      

Remember to put the mysql driver jar in the lib directory of the openshift 
tomcat instance. 

And lastly, I need to change the hibernate config for the openshift database,
 which essentially means changing the host from localhost to the server that 
 hosting MySql on Openshift: 127.5.237.130.
 
I ran into a goofy issue not being able to login to the tomcat manager app 
when I had the realm in the server.xml file. The way we originally added 
realms to our server.xml essentially enforced that realm for all apps 
deployed in that tomcat instance.  I need to set the realm
 up to be application specific rather than global to get around this issue. 
 
The solution: set up a realm for the specific application/context:

```
<!-- Change below for Openshift Deploy<Host name="localhost"  appBase="webapps" -->
          <Host name="OPENSHIFT_APP_DNS" appBase="webapps"
            unpackWARs="true" autoDeploy="true">
			
	        <!-- setting up realm only for fat bike trail reports app -->
		<Context path="/fbtr" debug="0" privileged="true" docBase="fbtr"> 	
			<Realm className="org.apache.catalina.realm.JDBCRealm"
	         driverName="com.mysql.jdbc.Driver"
	         connectionURL="jdbc:mysql://127.5.237.130:3306/FAT_BIKE_TRAIL_REPORTS?user=tomcat&amp;password=tomcat"
	         userTable="users" userNameCol="email_address" userCredCol="password"
	         userRoleTable="users_roles" roleNameCol="role"/>
		 </Context> 
			
        <!-- SingleSignOn valve, share authentication between web applications
             Documentation at: /docs/config/valve.html -->
        <!--
        <Valve className="org.apache.catalina.authenticator.SingleSignOn" />
        -->

        <!-- Access log processes all example.
             Documentation at: /docs/config/valve.html
             Note: The pattern used is equivalent to using pattern="common" -->
       <!-- <Valve className="org.apache.catalina.valves.AccessLogValve" directory="logs"
               prefix="localhost_access_log." suffix=".txt"
               pattern="%h %l %u %t &quot;%r&quot; %s %b" />-->

      </Host>
```
 
When troubleshooting your deploys to Openshift, it essential that you review 
the Catalina logs.  See this discussion for information on how to ssh to the 
server and navigate to the logs directory. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28469051/where-to-see-console-log-in-openshift
 
### Week 10

4/5 Add the servlet to add a new trail. I started simple just to verify the 
functionality, so I'm currently just passing in the trail name and zip code. 
The data is making it to the database.

I'm noticing a few issues: 1) page content is sneaking up under the nav bar 
and 2) when navigating from pages in the user directory to pages not in the 
user directory, the paths are off. An extra "user" is added to the path, so I
 have a little work to do with the relative paths here.
                     
### Week 11

4/6 Fixed the formatting issue with the nav bar by adding a little padding 
in the body. 

Fixed the relative path issue by moving all jsps back into the same directory
 and instead individually listing those that are restricted (need to log in to 
 access) in the web.xml. 
 
Put some styling around the trail report displafy.

Added an about page.

4/7 Spent some time working on navigation through the site and a few styling 
things. I'm stuck trying to get the footer to stick to the bottom. I'm going 
to put that on hold a bit and move onto other things. 

### Week 13

4/20

Currently at 85% coverage on TrailDao. Also 85% on TrailReports Dao. 
SessionFactory is at 88% (covered using the daotests).
Added in more fields in add trail jsp. Realized I need to complete daos for 
difficulty and type so that I can populate dropdowns.

4/24

Decided to add an abstract dao - I'm getting sick of the redundant code and 
it doesn't set a very good example not to do it.  Also added tests, 
specifically for Difficulty. On to type next... And then I should go back and 
fix/remove existing daos and use abstract instead. The only thing that should
 remain in the daos are anything specific.  Here's an interesting article to 
 even eliminate that part using hibernate named queries: http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/j-genericdao/

4/25-26

Finished adding the difficulty dropdown and the trail type dropdown. 
Connected new fields with the servlet so recently added fields are saved.

### Week 15

5/6

It's refactoring day.  After talking with Matt and seeing Alex's presentation
 on using annotations for hibernate entities, I decided to do away with the 
 xml config method and use annotations instead. I delete all the old entities
  and hibernate entity xmls and regenerated in IntelliJ.  I did have to add 
  the annotation for auto-generated ids. I also got rid of the user interface
   dao since it was only used as an example. Things seem much cleaner in the 
   project and tests pass.
